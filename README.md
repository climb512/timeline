The project was to create a dynamic, responsive timeline to display chronological events using JS and Sass. This demo silpy displays the widget.

1) Mobile support for 360px width and up (see explanation below).
2) Added :hover effects that span the text container, line and circled number.
3) Added the left-justified timeline layout for screens <= 768px.
   
-- Searching design resources on the web, all recommendations I found say that web designers should design for 360px and up in 2023.
I tested at 360px and above (the smallest Samsung Galaxy).  I could find no devices smaller than this that are relevant in 2023.  For instance, the iPhone 5,
with a 320px width, has been officially labeled as "obsolete" by Apple and is no longer getting support.  WhatsApp officially dropped support for it in 2022
